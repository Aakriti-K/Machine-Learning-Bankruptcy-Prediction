# Machine-Learning-Bankruptcy-Prediction

Here is a project where I have two files, one with the ML code for designing a model for bankruptcy prediction and another to deploy it on a streamlit server. I have selected top 15 features. If the user enters the value of 15 features asked on the Streamlit app, he can get to know the financial health of the company and the risk score of bankruptcy.
